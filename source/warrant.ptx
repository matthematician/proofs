        <p>
            I can write proofs that provide explicit justifications for the quantities they define and the inferences they draw, at every step for which it is audience-appropriate.

    <!-- A string of true statements does not make a proof; borrow the "1003 is prime" -->
    <!-- Warranted implication when introducing new components to a proof -->
    <!-- Warranted implication when drawing logical inferences -->
    <!-- Elements of audience: when is an explicit warrant needed? -->

    <!--All necessary steps are included.
        All steps are clearly explained.
        Proof uses definitions correctly.
        Variables are clearly defined.
        Diagrams are relevant and used effectively if appropriate.
        All information included is relevant to the proof. -->
