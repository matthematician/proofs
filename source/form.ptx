    <!-- The PROOF SANDWICH -->
    <!-- Tell em what you'll say, then say it, then tell em what you said -->

    <!-- Proof strategy is clear and appropriate.
         Proof uses appropriate assumptions for the proof technique being used.
         All steps are accurate and logically correct.
         Proof steps are presented in a logical sequence.
         Proof uses other theorems and results correctly if appropriate.
         Proof makes it clear that the conclusion is shown. -->
